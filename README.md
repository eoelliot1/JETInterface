# JET Restaurant Interface

## How to set up the test framework
1. **Clone the repository:** https://github.com/eoelliot1/JETInterface.git
2. Sync maven in pom.xml file.
3. Compile RestaurantInterface.java
4. Run RestaurantInterface.java
5. The progam will ask you to "Enter a postcode..."
    You must type a postcode for example: CT1 2EH  and hit enter.
6. The program should return with corressponding results the postcode inputted.

## Assumptions:
- By 'restaurant objects' I assumed it was refering to the restaurants field since that seemed to contain all the details that the assignment was looking for.
## Improvements:
- Could improve in how address data is displayed. Currently it just returns the object but it it might worth organising the output to make it more humanly interpretable.
